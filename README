This repo currently holds my programing projects for various classes at Missouri University of Science and Technology.
I personally do not care if you use this code as a reference but I mainly put it here so I can collaborate with partners.
I also personally do not care if you use it however this is against student policy so you DO NOT have my permission.
Using my code will not help you learn and will only create more incompetent engineers making it easier for me to get a job.
If you get in trouble for being stupid and using my code I absolve myself from responsibility, you dug your own grave.
If you are stupid and submit code with my name still on it I will also probably physically hurt you in some fashion.

TL;DR : I take no responsibility for students turning in this code. You do not have my permission to use but feel free to look.
